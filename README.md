# employee-spring-boot-poc
To design few RESTful application which covers most of the concepts of spring boot and possibly covers all use cases under that concept.

1. The poc project actually creates a rest application using a list as a storage. Main aim was to have a good understanding of 
all the possible scenarios/use cases like how to accept query param path param, headers how to send different responses from the same method. 

2. The employee-jpa actually deals with stored procedure in a db. The db used here is mysql. This application interacts with four stored proceudre, one having no IN param, one of them having 1 IN param, the other having 2 In param and the third having 1 IN and one OUT param.
